<p>The only thing that you absolutely have to kow is the location of the LIBRARY. -Albert Einstein</p>
    <h2 class="genre">K6 & K7</h2>
     <p> Bargain books are in rooms K6 and K7, where hardbound books are all $1, paperbacks are 50
cents each, and children's books are just 25 cents. On Sunday, prices in the bargain room are
half-off, plus you can save even more by purchasing grocery bags from us for $5 each and then
filling these with books. Please note that the Children's and Bargain rooms open one hour
earlier than the Main room on Saturday.
